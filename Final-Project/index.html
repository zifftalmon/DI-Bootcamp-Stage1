  <h4 class="center"><u> A quotation by Shalev concerning his writing</u>:<em>"The description of the bread-baking in 'Esau' and the stonemasonry in 'In his house in the desert' are based on meetings with professionals and on my continued adherence not to do what they do, but only to observe and write down lists. I never sent a dove, I did not chop a stone, I did not bake a loaf of bread and I did not buy and sell cows for meat."</em></h4>

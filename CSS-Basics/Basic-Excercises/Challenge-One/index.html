        <p>Shall I compare thee to a summes day?</p>
        <p>Thou art more lovely and more temperate</p>
        <p>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</p>
        <p>And summer's lease hath all too short a date:</p>
        <p>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines</p>
        <p>And often is his gold complexion dimm'd,</p>
        <p>And every fair from fair sometime declines,</p>
        <p>By chance, or natures changing course untrimm'd</p>
        <p>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,</p>
        <p>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,</p>
        <p>Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,</p>
        <p>When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,</p>
        <p>So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,</p>
        <p>so long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p>
